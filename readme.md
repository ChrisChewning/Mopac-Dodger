# PROJECT  								

This is my 1st full project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. It is an Austin, Texas twist on Frogger, where the road is our continually under-construction MoPac. Icons used were ones Austinites would hopefully find intrigue in - a taco truck, a Formula 1 racecar, a segway.

I chose to make a Frogger type game because it would challenge me as a developer in new ways. I needed to move things on a screen, create a collision function, set boundaries, and increase and decrease speeds. I chose to use Canvas so I could delve into something new and regarding Javascript & jQuery, I focused on classes, looping through animations & modals, and creating keyCodes.

This project stretched me in many ways but there is more to go. Next steps are to create rounds where the sprite's speed gets slower and the vehicles speed get faster & to be able to switch sprites per user. Another thought is to make a 'night mode' version, where there's a billboard with lights on it or something like that.

Technologies used: HTML5, Canvas, CSS, & jQuery.

## STORY																		  
An unstoppable behemoth named 'Californians' are plugging up Austin's MoPac Highway. It is up to you, or you and your non-Californian friend, to prove you can still cross MoPac without colliding into the endless amount of vehicles.

### USER
User will be able to:

1. Choose between one player version or two players.
2. See a timer displayed on the screen in a width bar, that counts down from 60 seconds and stops at 0.
3. Score a point if you cross MoPac without hitting another vehicle and see it displayed in the header.
4. Reset to your original starting point if you hit another vehicle.

5. If one player game, user will be able to play the first round & then receive the option to play again or cancel.

6. If two player game, users will be able to take turns, with player 1 going first. After both players have taken a turn, users will be able to see who won, which will coincide with the scoreboard.
